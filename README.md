## Contribute

If you want to contribute, look for open issues and start there. You will have to get contributer access - so get in touch with me if you would like to contribute. Alternately, you can fork the repo and raise PRs from your fork.

1. clone the repo
2. create a feature branch
3. implement the issue
4. raise a pull request

If there are no open issues, you can either:
- look for something that needs to be done and open an issue (I will respond to the issue)
- reach out to me on twitter (@JanelBrandon12) with a DM and I'll raise an issue for you to work on after we chat
